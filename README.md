##Solar System
This is a very simple program to simulate the solar system(Well...actually we can't call it is simulating, for the planet doesn't follow the phisics law,but you can change the orbital of every planet).

###Installation
I use cmake

###others
I build this program on OSX 10.11, so I'm not sure the program will run correct on other platform.
